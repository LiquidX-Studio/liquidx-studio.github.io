This video was recorded as part of a presentation to the internal team and is used as part of the onboarding process to the Pixelmon project.
In this video our Director of Game Technology, Sean-Li Murmann, goes over some of the basics of using Perforce, UnrealGameSync & TeamCity and how these tools integrate with one another. We go over the basics of submitting changes to the project via Unreal Engine and P4V, the information that UnrealGameSync provides and how it links with TeamCity to provide the entire team with a birds eye overview of the state of our project.
